# Feature Engineering for Model Performance Improvement

This GitHub repository contains SQL code for feature engineering in the context of improving model performance for an e-commerce dataset. The code is designed to enhance the predictive accuracy of a machine learning model used for customer behavior analysis.

## Overview

In the field of data science and machine learning, feature engineering plays a pivotal role in model development. This repository focuses on augmenting the dataset used to train a machine learning model for an e-commerce website. The goal is to improve the accuracy of predicting whether a visitor will make a purchase on a return visit.

## Repository Contents

The repository consists of the following components:

1. **SQL Code Files:**
    - [`create_model.sql`](create_model.sql): This SQL script creates a logistic regression model for predicting whether a visitor will buy on a return visit using a provided e-commerce dataset.

    - [`feature_engineering.sql`](feature_engineering.sql): This SQL script augments the dataset with new features, including visitor behavior on the site, traffic source details, device information, and geographic data. These additional features are aimed at improving model accuracy.

2. **README.md (This File):** Provides an overview of the repository, its contents, and instructions on using the SQL code for feature engineering.

## Getting Started

To use the SQL code provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shaquib01-improve_model_performance_feature_engineering.git
   ```

2. Make sure you have access to a BigQuery project with the necessary dataset (`data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`) or replace it with your dataset.

3. Open and execute the SQL code in the following order:

    - Execute `create_model.sql` to create the initial logistic regression model.
    
    - Execute `feature_engineering.sql` to perform feature engineering and create an improved dataset.

4. Customize the SQL code as needed for your specific dataset or project requirements.
